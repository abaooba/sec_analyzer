# SEC Analyzer — What This Project Is & Everything It Taught Me

A from-scratch tool that takes a company name, pulls its real SEC filings and
financial data, scores it across five dimensions, detects what changed
year-over-year, mixes in live news, and then has an LLM write an analyst-grade
opinion on top. CLI **and** web API.

This document is the "field notes" version: every resource, library, concept,
and clever trick that went into building it by hand.

```

The whole thing is **deliberately "old school"**: regex and weighted keyword
counts do the heavy lifting, not machine learning. The LLM is the *last* layer,
not the engine. That makes every score explainable.

## 2. The data sources (the genuinely cool part)

Everything here is **free and public** — no paid data vendor.

| Source | What it gives | How it's accessed |
|---|---|---|
| **SEC EDGAR `company_tickers.json`** | Every ticker → CIK mapping | One JSON download, matched in Python |
| **SEC `submissions/CIK##########.json`** | A company's filing history | `data.sec.gov` REST |
| **SEC `companyfacts` XBRL API** | Structured financials (revenue, assets, …) | `data.sec.gov/api/xbrl` |
| **SEC `Archives/edgar/data/...`** | The raw filing HTML documents | `www.sec.gov/Archives` |
| **Google News RSS** | Live news headlines, no API key | `news.google.com/rss/search?q=...` |

### Things I learned about the SEC API specifically
- **CIK = Central Index Key**, the SEC's permanent id for a filer. It must be
  **zero-padded to 10 digits** for the JSON APIs (`"320193"` → `"0000320193"`)…
- …**but** in the archive document URL the CIK has its **leading zeros stripped**
  and the accession number has its **dashes removed**. Two different conventions
  for the same ids — a classic real-world API gotcha.
- The SEC **requires a descriptive `User-Agent`** header (name + email) or it
  returns `403`. This is their fair-access policy, not optional.
- The submissions API returns filings as **parallel arrays** (column-oriented):
  `form[i]`, `accessionNumber[i]`, `filingDate[i]` all line up by index. You
  `zip()` them back into rows.
- **XBRL** (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is the standardized
  financial-data format. One "fact" = a tagged number for a period
  (`tag=Revenues, unit=USD, fy=2023, val=...`). The same fact gets repeated
  across many filings, so **de-duplication on ingest is essential**.
- **us-gaap vs ifrs-full**: US filers tag under `us-gaap`, foreign filers under
  `ifrs-full`, and they use *different names for the same concept*
  (`Revenues` vs `Revenue` vs `RevenueFromContractsWithCustomers`). Hence the
  whitelist-of-synonyms approach in `fundamentals.py` and `metrics.py`.

### Filing form types (a mini accounting glossary I picked up)
| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **10-K** | US annual report (the big one) |
| **10-Q** | US quarterly report |
| **8-K** | US "material event" report (ad hoc) |
| **20-F** | Annual report for **foreign** private issuers |
| **6-K** | Interim report for foreign issuers |
| **40-F** | Annual report for **Canadian** issuers |

## 3. Libraries used (and *why* each one)

| Library | Role in this project | Why it / what I learned |
|---|---|---|
| **httpx** | All HTTP calls (SEC, news) | Modern `requests` successor; clean context-manager clients, timeouts, redirect following, `raise_for_status()` |
| **SQLAlchemy 2.0** | ORM / database | Typed `Mapped[...]` + `mapped_column` style, `select()` core queries, `sessionmaker`, `Base.metadata.create_all()` |
| **pydantic v2** | Settings + request/response schemas + LLM validation | `BaseModel` as a typed config bag, automatic type coercion, FastAPI request bodies, validating LLM JSON |
| **FastAPI** | The web API | Decorator routes, automatic JSON (de)serialization from pydantic models, dependency-free request validation |
| **uvicorn** | ASGI server to run FastAPI | `uvicorn backend.api:app --reload` |
| **CORS middleware** | Let a browser frontend call the API | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing basics |
| **python-dotenv** | Load secrets from `.env` | Keeps API keys out of source control |
| **feedparser** | Parse RSS/Atom feeds | Turns Google News RSS XML into structured entries |
| **trafilatura** | Extract clean article text from a URL | Boilerplate removal (strips nav/ads), main-content extraction |
| **groq** | LLM inference client | OpenAI-compatible chat API, **JSON mode**, very fast Llama hosting |
| **(stdlib) re** | The actual workhorse | Section extraction + all keyword scoring is regex |
| **(stdlib) pathlib** | Path handling | `Path`, `.resolve()`, `parents[]`, `.mkdir()`, `.write_text()` |
| **(stdlib) urllib.parse** | `quote_plus` for building search URLs | URL-encoding query strings |

## 4. Concepts & techniques I actually learned by doing this

### Software / Python
- **Layered architecture**: `config → db/models → clients → ingest → parse →
  scoring → opinion → entry points`. Each layer only imports "downward." Two
  entry points (CLI + API) share one pipeline.
- **The `settings` singleton pattern**: one pydantic object built once at import,
  imported everywhere, so configuration lives in exactly one place.
- **Path-resolution that's independent of the working directory** — resolving
  relative to the repo root so the app behaves identically whether launched from
  the repo, the backend folder, or uvicorn.
- **`if __package__ in {None, ""}: sys.path.insert(...)`** — the shim that lets a
  file run both as `python -m backend.main` *and* as a loose script.
- **Upsert pattern**: `session.get(...)` → update if found, insert if not.
- **De-duplication via a uniqueness tuple** (XBRL facts) and via a **set** for
  O(1) membership tests (new-sentence detection).
- **`try/finally` for cleanup**: cached HTML is always deleted, even on error.
- **Graceful degradation**: no LLM key → return `None` and fall back to the
  rule-based output; news fetch fails → score on filing exposure alone. The app
  never hard-crashes on an optional dependency.
- **Client-side rate limiting**: a process-wide throttle (last-call timestamp +
  a `threading.Lock`) spaces SEC requests to honor an API's fair-access policy —
  a single shared limiter rather than per-object, so a tight download loop can't
  burst past the limit.
- **Bounded, best-effort enrichment**: full article-body fetching is capped to a
  few articles and silently skips failures, so an expensive/flaky network step
  improves quality without ever blocking the result.
- **Parallel-array → row** transformation with `zip()`.

### Regex (this project is a regex bootcamp)
- Inline flags: `(?i)` ignore-case, `(?is)` ignore-case + dotall (`.` matches
  newlines), `(?s)` dotall.
- **Word boundaries** `\b` so `\binflation\b` doesn't match inside other words.
- **Lookbehind** `(?<=[.!?])\s+` to split sentences *after* punctuation without
  consuming it.
- Non-greedy matching `.*?` to strip `<script>…</script>` blocks.
- HTML → text **without a parser**: drop script/style/head, convert block-closing
  tags to newlines, strip remaining tags, decode entities, collapse whitespace.

### Information retrieval / NLP-lite
- **Anchor-based section extraction**: find a heading ("Item 1A. Risk Factors"),
  treat the *next* heading as the end boundary, and slice between them. With
  heuristics to (a) skip the table of contents, and (b) prefer a chunk long
  enough to be the real section over a stub.
- **Count "softening"** (`0 / 1-2 / 3-5 / 6+ → 0/1/2/3`) so a term repeated 40
  times doesn't dominate — we care about *emphasis*, not raw frequency.
- **Weighted, capped scoring**: per-category caps + category weights + a total
  cap, so no single signal can run away with the score.
- **Evidence extraction**: pulling the actual sentences that triggered a score,
  which both explains the number to a human and grounds the LLM.
- **Set-difference change detection**: this year's sentences minus last year's =
  newly added language (often the most interesting part of a filing).

### Finance (picked up along the way)
- **Operating margin** = operating income / revenue.
- **ROE** (return on equity) ≈ net income / equity.
- **Free cash flow** ≈ operating cash flow − capex.
- **Leverage**: debt/equity (preferred) or debt/assets (fallback).
- **Balance-sheet strength**: liabilities / assets, plus equity sign.
- **"Moat"** = durable competitive advantage (brand, switching costs, IP, scale,
  network/ecosystem lock-in) — Buffett's term, operationalized here as keyword
  categories.

### LLM / AI engineering
- **System prompt that pins an exact output schema** (the six required JSON keys).
- **JSON mode** (`response_format={"type": "json_object"}`) to force valid JSON.
- **pydantic validation of the model's response** so a malformed reply is caught.
- **Low temperature (0.2)** for grounded, repeatable output.
- **Context budgeting**: truncating filing excerpts to fit the prompt window.
- **The LLM as the *last* layer**: deterministic scores first (explainable),
  narrative synthesis second. The AI is asked to *critique* the keyword scores
  ("do they over/understate the real risk?"), not produce them.

| `backend/api.py` | FastAPI `/analyze` endpoint |
| `backend/main.py` | Interactive CLI with a formatted terminal report |

---

## 6. How the final score is built

```
overall =  financial        * 0.25
        + (100 − risk)       * 0.20      # inverted: more risk language = worse
        +  business_model    * 0.20
        +  moat              * 0.15
        + (100 − geopolitics)* 0.20      # inverted: more exposure = worse
```

Weights sum to 1.0; the result is clamped to 0–100. The two "bad" meters (risk,
geopolitics) are inverted so the final number always reads "higher = better."

---

## 7. Cleanup pass — what got connected back
A later pass removed the loose ends so nothing dangles:
- **`article_extractor.py` is now wired into the geopolitics scorer.** It fetches
  the real body text of the top few news articles (bounded by
  `FULL_TEXT_ARTICLE_LIMIT`, best-effort) so classification sees more than the
  headline. The result now reports `full_text_article_count`.
- **`max_requests_per_second` is now enforced.** `sec_client._throttle()` is a
  process-wide rate limiter (timestamp + lock) every SEC call passes through, so
  the ingest download loop stays under the SEC's fair-access limit.
- **The model label can no longer drift.** `LLM_MODEL` / `LLM_DISPLAY_NAME` live
  in `llm_analysis.py` as the single source of truth; the CLI imports the display
  name instead of hardcoding it (it used to wrongly print "Claude Opus 4.7").
- **Config is honest.** `llm_analysis` now reads `settings.groq_api_key` instead
  of `os.getenv` directly, and the dead `news_api_*` / `processed_data_dir`
  settings and the unused `extract_latest_10k_sections` alias were removed —
  every remaining `Settings` field now has a real consumer.

### Still open / future work
- `allow_origins=["*"]` and `verify=False` (TLS) are convenient but should be
  tightened for anything real.
- HTML parsing is pure regex — robust enough for SEC filings, but a parser like
  `selectolax`/`lxml` would be sturdier (the dependency is even installed).
- Keyword lists in `moat.py` lean toward semiconductor/equipment language,
  reflecting the filings this was first tuned against — generalizing them is
  future work.

---

## 8. The one-sentence takeaway
You can build a genuinely useful equity-research tool out of **free public data,
a pile of well-chosen regexes, a SQLite database, and a thin LLM layer** — and
keeping the AI *last* is what makes every number it reports explainable.

---

## 9. Iteration log (self-improvement loop)

This section is the running log. Each iteration: pick the single highest-priority
unfinished backlog item (T0→T5, security/test-debt first), ship one closed +
tested + committed unit, and append a dated entry here.

### 2026-06-24 — T0 SECURITY: stop tracking `.env`, fix `.gitignore`, add `.env.example`

**What changed**
- `git rm --cached backend/app/.env`. The file had been *re-staged* (`A` in
  `git status`) this session even though an earlier commit (`d470b87`) claimed to
  stop tracking it. Removed it from the index again; working-tree copy preserved
  (local real keys intact, byte-identical on disk).
- Rewrote `.gitignore`: split the broken `*.pyc.env` line into `*.pyc` + `.env`,
  added `**/.env` (the old `backend/.env` rule never matched the real path
  `backend/app/.env`), and `!.env.example` so the template stays trackable.
- Added `.env.example` with empty/placeholder values for exactly the **6** env
  vars `config.py` actually reads: `SEC_USER_AGENT`, `GROQ_API_KEY`,
  `DATABASE_URL`, `RAW_FILINGS_DIR`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND`.
  Dropped the dead `NEWS_API_*` / `PROCESSED_DATA_DIR` entries that still lingered
  in the on-disk `.env` (no code reads them — confirmed by grep).

**Why** — `.env` with live credentials was committed in `1e2124b` / `f417aa6`,
removed in `d470b87`, but those secret blobs remain reachable from `origin/main`
on a **PUBLIC** GitHub repo (`github.com/abaooba/sec_analyzer`). The `.gitignore`
was also broken, so the file kept getting re-added.

**🚨 REQUIRED — provider-side, NOT done by me (a real secret cannot be faked):**
- **Rotate the Groq key** (`gsk_…`) at https://console.groq.com/keys — revoke the
  leaked one, issue a new one, drop it in local `.env`.
- **Rotate the News API key** (`06ac…`, newsapi.org-style) in that provider's
  console — even though `config.py` no longer reads it, it is a live leaked
  credential that was pushed publicly.
- The leaked keys remain in **public git history**; rotation is what neutralizes
  them. A full history scrub (`git filter-repo` + force-push) is the optional
  deep-clean but is destructive and rewrites public history, so it is left to the
  user — not run autonomously (the loop forbids force-push / destructive git).

**Verification** — `git check-ignore -v` confirms `backend/app/.env` is ignored
(via `**/.env`) and `.env.example` is trackable; `.env` no longer appears in
`git status`; `from app.config import settings` still imports; `.env` content
intact on disk (explicit-path `load_dotenv` still loads the real Groq key).

**Discovered (not fixed — future work)** — bare `load_dotenv()` searches the CWD
upward, so it does **not** find `backend/app/.env` when the app is launched from
the repo root; the Groq key then silently fails to load and the LLM layer degrades
to rule-only. Latent config-robustness bug → candidate for **T2** (point
`load_dotenv` at an explicit repo-relative path, e.g. `BACKEND_DIR/"app/.env"`).

**Now unblocked / next iteration** — T0 code remediation is complete; only the
provider-side key rotation remains (on the user). Start **T1 SAFETY NET** next:
pytest suite (opinion.py blend formula, count-softening buckets, metrics.py
ratios, parse_filings.py section extraction with a saved filing fixture; mock
SEC/Groq), then ruff + mypy config + missing type hints, then GitHub Actions CI.
NOTE: this repo currently has **no test or lint tooling at all**, so T1 is the
prerequisite for every later tier — do it before any T2+ work.

### 2026-06-24 — T1 SAFETY NET (part 1): pytest suite

**What changed** — Added the test net, *purely additively* (new files only, no
edits to any existing module):
- `pyproject.toml` — `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` (`pythonpath=["."]`,
  `testpaths=["backend/tests"]`).
- `requirements-dev.txt` — pins `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy` (installed into `.venv`).
- `backend/tests/conftest.py` — an isolated **in-memory SQLite** fixture
  (`StaticPool` so it survives multiple `SessionLocal()` calls) + monkeypatches
  that repoint `metrics`/`parse_filings` `SessionLocal` at it, so DB tests never
  touch the real `sec_analyzer.db`.
- `backend/tests/fixtures/sample_10k.html` — a synthetic 10-K (dense TOC +
  substantive Business / Risk / MD&A sections, each with a unique marker).
- `test_risk_scoring.py`, `test_metrics.py`, `test_parse_filings.py`,
  `test_opinion.py` — **53 tests, all green** covering the four brief areas:
  count-softening buckets + risk scoring; metrics formatters + the derived-ratio
  math (via seeded DB, incl. divide-by-zero/missing guards + latest-fact pick);
  HTML→text + section extraction on the fixture + TOC-skip + choose/combine;
  and the opinion **blend formula**.

**How the blend is tested (and how SEC/Groq are "mocked")** — instead of editing
`opinion.py` to extract a helper (which would have meant touching WIP — see below),
the blend is exercised through the *real* `build_full_opinion` with all five
scorers + `detect_filing_changes` + `generate_llm_analysis` monkeypatched to fixed
values. That keeps it offline (no SEC/Groq/DB) yet verifies the real `.25/.20/.20/
.15/.20` weighting, the risk & geopolitics inversion, the clamp, and the CIK
zero-padding — not a re-implementation.

**Why purely additive (important constraint)** — the working tree carries an
**806-line uncommitted diff** across 22 files: the "cleanup pass" documented in
§7 (docstrings + the throttle / article-extractor wiring). It is the user's
complete-but-uncommitted work; bundling it into a test commit (or committing it on
their behalf) was out of scope, so this iteration touched **zero** existing files
and committed only new ones. The diff is still uncommitted.

**Discovered** — the section extractor *balloons* a section when the TOC is too
sparse: a TOC-origin "Management's Discussion" candidate runs forward past the
100-char end-anchor skip and swallows later sections, because the `>=3 Item refs`
TOC-skip heuristic doesn't trip. Fixed in-fixture by using a realistically dense
TOC (documented in `sample_10k.html`). Worth knowing as a real parser limitation
on filings with unusually short TOCs.

**Verification** — `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` → **53 passed**. `ruff check
backend/tests` → clean. DB tests confirmed isolated (no `.db` file written).

**Now unblocked / next iteration** — **T1 part 2: ruff + mypy config + type-hint
backfill.** Baseline already measured: `ruff check backend/app` = **1** issue
(unused `pathlib.Path` import in `parse_filings.py`); lenient `mypy backend/app` =
**15** errors in 9 files (mostly `var-annotated` + a few real ones in
`parse_filings`/`metrics`/`llm_analysis`/`rss_ingest`). `main.py`/`api.py` add 7
more ruff issues (intentional "legacy kept for reference" `F811`s) — scope the lint
gate to `backend/app` first. ⚠️ **These fixes necessarily edit the same 22 files
that hold the uncommitted cleanup-pass diff** — so the next iteration must FIRST
resolve that working tree (commit the cleanup pass, or have the user confirm) to
avoid bundling WIP. Then T1 part 3 = GitHub Actions CI (pytest + ruff + mypy).

### 2026-06-24 — T1 SAFETY NET (CI): GitHub Actions

**What changed** — Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (purely additive): on every
push / PR it sets up Python 3.13, installs `requirements.txt` +
`requirements-dev.txt`, and runs `pytest`. Offline by design (SEC/Groq
monkeypatched, DB in-memory) so CI needs no secrets. Validated the YAML parses
and that the exact CI command (`pytest`) is green locally (53 passed).

**Deliberately pytest-only for now** — ruff + mypy steps are omitted until
`backend/app` actually passes them (1 ruff + 15 mypy issues outstanding); adding
them now would make CI red. They join the workflow in the ruff/mypy bullet. CI
activates on the user's next push (the leaked-key rotation should happen first).

### 2026-06-24 — User decision + T3: root README

**Decision recorded** — Asked the user how to handle the uncommitted 806-line
cleanup pass (it blocks ruff/mypy + all of T2, which edit those 22 files). They
chose **"leave it; additive-only"**: do NOT touch the uncommitted files, ship only
new-file units until they commit the cleanup pass themselves. So T1-ruff/mypy and
all of T2 are **parked** pending the user committing that working tree.

**What changed (T3)** — Added a root `README.md` (additive, new file). Quick-start
focused (clone → venv → `pip install` → `cp .env.example .env` + `SEC_USER_AGENT`
→ run CLI `python -m backend.main` or API `uvicorn backend.api:app --reload`),
with a CI badge, the compact pipeline diagram, the exact blend formula (verified
against `opinion.py`: weights `.25/.20/.20/.15/.20`), the five-dimension table,
the test command, and the free-data-source list. `LEARNINGS.md` stays the deep
reference. The repo previously had only an empty `backend/Readme.md`.

**Verification** — Markdown fences balanced; blend weights cross-checked against
source; entry-point commands confirmed (`main.py` has a `__main__`/`main()` that
calls `init_db()`; `api.py` exposes `POST /analyze` with `{company_name, ticker?}`).

**Now unblocked / next iteration** — While the cleanup pass stays uncommitted, the
only remaining additive (no-WIP) candidate is T3's *prune-unused-deps* (edits only
`requirements.txt`; needs grep verification — note `requirements.txt` looks
pip-freeze-style, so confirm it's a direct-deps list before pruning). Everything
higher-priority (T1 ruff/mypy, all T2) and all features (T4/T5) remain blocked —
T4/T5 also gated on T1 being *fully* done. The cleanest path forward is for the
user to **commit the cleanup pass**, which immediately unblocks T1-ruff/mypy → T2.

### 2026-06-25 — Cleanup pass committed → T0 `.env.example` re-track + T1 lint/type gate

**Context unblock** — the user committed the 806-line "cleanup pass" as `9b3234a`
("new changes"): the exact 22-file docstring/wiring diff from §7/§9 that every
later tier was parked behind (T1-ruff/mypy and all of T2 edit those same files).
With it committed the working tree is clean and those tiers are unblocked.
Confirmed the lint/type **baseline is unchanged** by the cleanup pass (it added
docstrings + wiring, not annotations): still **1 ruff + 15 mypy**.

**T0 follow-up (commit `f9bb8f7`)** — `9b3234a` also *deleted* the tracked
`.env.example` that T0 added (its diff showed `.env.example | 21 ------`); the file
survived only as an untracked copy on disk. Re-added it so the repo keeps the
secret-free template. Verified secret-free first — all 6 vars (`SEC_USER_AGENT`,
`GROQ_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `RAW_FILINGS_DIR`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`,
`MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND`) empty/placeholder; `.gitignore`'s `!.env.example`
negation keeps it trackable.

**T1 lint/type gate (commit `7bb0e48`)** — stood up the static-analysis gate on
`backend/app`, driving all 16 baseline issues to zero:
- **Config** (`pyproject.toml`): `[tool.ruff]` + `[tool.ruff.lint]` (default
  `E4/E7/E9/F`, pinned for version-stability; `target py313`) and `[tool.mypy]`
  (`files=["backend/app"]`, `ignore_missing_imports`, `py313`). Deliberately **not**
  `--strict`: the gate catches real type errors without demanding full annotation
  coverage (strict would surface hundreds of trivial ones and stall the loop).
- **1 ruff fix**: removed the unused `pathlib.Path` import (`F401`).
- **15 mypy fixes** — several real latent bugs, not just annotations:
  - A `_SectionCandidate` **TypedDict** for the heterogeneous candidate dicts in
    `parse_filings` — one type fixed *four* errors at once (the `var-annotated`,
    the `object`-typed `word_count >=` comparison, and both
    `Incompatible return value (object vs str)`).
  - `var-annotated`: `category_sentences` (risk/moat/business_model),
    `category_articles` (geopolitics), `changes` (opinion), `formatted` (metrics),
    `seen_starts`.
  - `parse_filings`: `filings.sort()` → `sorted()` — `.scalars().all()` returns an
    immutable `Sequence[Filing]` (no `.sort()`); `sorted()` is also non-mutating,
    strictly better.
  - `metrics`: `filtered = list(rows)` (was assigning a `Sequence` to a `list` var).
  - `rss_client`: `fetch_feed` now returns `feedparser.FeedParserDict` — it was
    annotated `-> dict`, which made mypy reject the legitimate `.entries` access in
    `rss_ingest`.
  - **`llm_analysis` (real bug):** `response.choices[0].message.content` is
    `str | None` but was passed straight to `json.loads`. Added an
    `if not raw: raise ValueError(...)` guard — a `None`/empty completion would
    previously have raised `TypeError`; it now degrades cleanly with a meaningful
    message through the existing `except`.
- **CI** (`ci.yml`): added `Lint (ruff check backend/app)` + `Type-check
  (mypy backend/app)` steps before the test step; refreshed the header comment.
  Still fully offline — no secrets.

**Verification** — `ruff check backend/app` clean; `mypy` → "no issues found in 22
source files"; `pytest` → **53 passed**; `ci.yml` parses (`yaml.safe_load`) and the
exact CI commands were dry-run locally, all green.

**Scope held deliberately** — gate scoped to `backend/app` (the core library).
`main.py` / `api.py` still carry **7** intentional `F811` "legacy kept for
reference" duplicate defs; removing/linting those is a distinct T3-cleanup unit,
not part of the type gate.

**Now unblocked / next iteration** — **T1 is complete** (pytest ✅, CI ✅, ruff+mypy
gate ✅). Highest-priority open work moves to **T2 ROBUSTNESS**, whose `backend/app`
edits are no longer blocked. Best first T2 unit: the **`load_dotenv` path bug**
(config.py — a bare `load_dotenv()` searches CWD-upward and misses
`backend/app/.env` when launched from the repo root, so the Groq key silently
fails to load and the LLM degrades to rule-only). Then CORS scope, drop
`verify=False`, structured logging, externalize scoring keywords/weights,
LLM-validation retry+fallback. Adjacent small cleanup: the 7 entry-point `F811`s.
T0 key rotation remains the only ⏳ user-blocked item.

### 2026-06-25 — T2 ROBUSTNESS (part 1): CWD-independent `.env` loading

**The bug** — `config.py` called a bare `load_dotenv()`, which searches *upward
from the current working directory*. Empirically (this machine): launched from the
repo root it loads `./.env` and the Groq key *is* present — so it looks fine and
hid the defect. But the search is CWD-dependent: a process launched from outside
the repo tree (a systemd service, an installed console entry point, any other cwd)
finds **no** `.env`, so `GROQ_API_KEY` silently stays unset and `llm_analysis`
quietly degrades to rule-only output with no error. (This corrects the T1-entry's
guess that it "misses `backend/app/.env` from the repo root" — the real trigger is
launching from *outside* the tree. Verified bug→fix by importing `config` from
`/tmp`: Groq key empty before, loaded after.)

**Also surfaced** — there are **two** `.env` files on disk: the canonical repo-root
`./.env` (exactly the 6 vars `config.py` reads, matching `.env.example`) and a
legacy `backend/app/.env` (those 6 + the dead `NEWS_API_*` / `PROCESSED_DATA_DIR`
vars T0 already stopped reading). Bare `load_dotenv()` made *which* one wins depend
on the launch dir — another facet of the nondeterminism.

**The fix (commit `8a1ed46`)** — extracted `_load_env_files(*paths) -> list[Path]`:
loads each existing `.env` by its **absolute path** (`override=False`, so a value
already in the real environment still wins) and returns what it loaded. At import
we call it with `(REPO_ROOT/".env", BACKEND_DIR/"app"/".env")` — repo-root
canonical first, legacy fallback second — both resolved relative to `__file__`, so
loading no longer depends on the cwd. Moved `BACKEND_DIR`/`REPO_ROOT` above the
call so they're in scope for it.

**Tests** — new `backend/tests/test_config.py` (4): explicit-path load,
skip-missing, no-override (real env wins), and first-path-wins precedence (why
repo-root beats legacy). All use throwaway `tmp_path` `.env` files — never the
developer's real `.env` — so they stay fully offline / CI-safe.

**Verification** — `pytest` **57 passed** (53 + 4); `ruff check backend/app` clean;
`mypy backend/app` clean; manual `/tmp` import confirms the Groq key now loads
regardless of launch directory.

**Now unblocked / next iteration** — T2 continues. Remaining T2 items (all edit
`backend/app`): drop `verify=False` (TLS verification disabled in `sec_client.py`
and `rss_client.py`), tighten CORS (`allow_origins=["*"]` in `api.py`), structured
`logging` over bare `print`, externalize scoring keywords/weights, LLM-validation
retry+fallback. Smaller adjacent cleanup: the 7 entry-point `F811`s. (T0 key
rotation still ⏳ user-side.)

### Backlog status (mirror of the /timebox brief — keep in sync)
- **T0 SECURITY** — code remediation ✅ (untrack `.env`, fix `.gitignore`, add
  `.env.example`; committed). `.env.example` re-tracked ✅ (`f9bb8f7`) after the
  cleanup-pass commit `9b3234a` silently dropped it from tracking. Key rotation ⏳
  **BLOCKED on user** (provider-side; cannot be done autonomously).
- **T1 SAFETY NET** — ✅ **complete**. pytest suite ✅ (53 tests). GitHub Actions
  CI ✅. ruff + mypy config + type-hint backfill ✅ (`7bb0e48`: 16 issues → 0, gate
  scoped to `backend/app`, both wired into CI). Remaining nit: 7 intentional
  `F811`s in `main.py`/`api.py` (entry points) → fold into a T3 cleanup unit.
- **T2 ROBUSTNESS** — 🟦 in progress. `load_dotenv` CWD-dependence ✅ (`8a1ed46`:
  load `.env` by explicit absolute path, + 4 tests). Remaining: drop `verify=False`
  (TLS, `sec_client.py`/`rss_client.py`), tighten CORS (`allow_origins=["*"]` in
  `api.py`), structured logging over `print`, externalize scoring keywords/weights,
  LLM-validation retry+fallback.
- **T3 CLEANUP** — 🟦 root README ✅ (committed). Prune-unused-deps ✅ investigated
  → **no-op**: `beautifulsoup4`/`justext`/`courlan`/`dateparser` aren't unused —
  they're transitive deps of `trafilatura`/`htmldate`/`lxml` (pip reinstalls them
  regardless), and `requirements.txt` is pip-freeze-style, so pruning only loosens
  pins. Leave the freeze intact, or adopt a `requirements.in` (direct deps) +
  pip-compile flow — a user call, not done autonomously. Open: async rate limiter
  (now unblocked — `sec_client.py` WIP is committed) + the 7 entry-point `F811`s.
- **T4 SIGNATURE FEATURES** — ⬜ T0–T1 prerequisite now ✅ (only T0 key-rotation,
  user-side, still pending); features gated behind T2 (forensics scores,
  confidence, trajectory, backtesting).
- **T5 REACH FEATURES** — ⬜ (insider/institutional, peer-relative, contradiction
  detector, RAG Q&A, frontend, watchlist/alerts, PDF export).
